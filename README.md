# Lint configuration files

These are files used across our projects to lint our files.

## Install

1. Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed in your environment.
1. `cd` to the root of your projectâ€™s repository.
1. Run `$ npm install juwai/juwai-lint-cfg --save-dev` to install the module from
    git and save it to the configuration of the project.
1. Files should be now copied to the root of your repository, ready to lint your code!
